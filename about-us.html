    <p>It all started long long ago, although I won’t say quite how long. Even though we fell in love at the wrong time at first, we have since come together in good health to support one another in our lives. Ethan, you are so patient and understanding, and you sincerely love me for who I am. I couldn’t have asked for a better partner, even though I willed having you back in my life as hard as I possibly could. You are one in a million and I truly treasure you and love you deeply. You are my rock and I don’t know what I’d do or where I’d be without you.</p>
    <p>I love you, happy birthday.</p>
    <p>Love,</p>
    <p>Abigail Joy Miller</p>
